lore
Lords get a point on the package

Vampires can't use smart phones. If they were tracked 24/7 the entire order would be exposed. The biometric data alone would tip off the NSA of a supernatural user.
that's a bit confusing?
we live in the shadows, we don't write everything in a diary. vampire history is less of a stream and more of a puddle.

Vampires have all memories from their human life, but they are cold blooded reptiles who don't care to think about it. The only thing that makes vampires remember their pre birth is seeing someone they remember or experiencing a sensation that brings back vivid memories.

Triggering flashbacks makes vampires feel human emotions associated with those memories. Most vampires recommend avoiding these flashbacks to keep your mind clear and focused.
